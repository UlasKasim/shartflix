## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (version 3.0 or higher)
- Dart SDK
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code, Android Studio)
- API access for movie data (configure via `.env`)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UlasKasim/shartflix.git
   cd shartflix
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
   - Copy the contents of `.env.example` and update the `BASE_URL` with the appropriate API endpoint.

     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Example `.env` content:

     ```env
     BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
     ```

4. **Generate Code**: Run the following command to generate necessary files (e.g., for dependency injection, JSON serialization):

   ```bash
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

5. **Run the App**:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Running Tests

To execute the test suite:

```bash
flutter test
```

**Note**: Current test coverage is approximately 10% due to time constraints. Contributions to improve test coverage are welcome!

## ðŸ“š Additional Notes

- Ensure the API endpoint in `.env` is accessible to avoid network errors.
- For code generation issues, re-run the `build_runner` command with `--delete-conflicting-outputs`.
